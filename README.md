# PHP test IP
This webpage/script will help you with validating your IPv4 and IPv6 local and remote addresses of your local computer and web server.
The script will validate if you are connecting with IPv4 or IPv6 to the webpage and will also validate if you are using HTTP or HTTPS.

A live example (or demo) is can be found here:
<a href="[http://example.com/](https://iwanhoogendoorn.nl/phptestip/)" target="_blank">PHP test IP Demo</a>

Place the files in the webserver root directory of a sub-directory.

```
My webserver root folder:
/usr/share/nginx/html
